# Block Interval (Constant Block Delay) Sweep

Explores how different block intervals affect system performance while keeping chain delays constant in blocks.

## Key Features

- Sweeps block intervals with configurable step size
- Keeps second chain delay constant in blocks (not time)
- Tests impact of block production rate on system performance
- Maintains constant TPS across all simulations
