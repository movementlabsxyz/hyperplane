# Block Interval (Constant Time Delay) Sweep

Explores how different block intervals affect system performance while keeping chain delays constant in time.

## Key Features

- Sweeps block intervals with configurable step size
- Keeps second chain delay constant in time (not blocks)
- Calculates block delays as: delay_blocks = reference_time / block_interval
- Tests impact of block production rate on system performance
