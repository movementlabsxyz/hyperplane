# CAT Ratio Sweep

Varies the ratio of CAT transactions from 0.0 (no CATs) to maximum values.

## Key Features

- Sweeps CAT ratio from 0.0 to configurable maximum
- Configurable step size for ratio increments

## Results

Despite increased CAT ratio, the number of pending regular transactions is not increased much, indicating that the system maintains stable performance for regular transactions even with higher CAT loads.
